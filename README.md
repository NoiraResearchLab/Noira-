## 🗺 Roadmap

Noira evolves through three phases — from reactive detection to autonomous, predictive blockchain intelligence.

### ✅ Phase I — Calibration Protocol *(MVP Complete)*  
**Status:** Released — Q3 2025

Noira's foundation was built to detect the unseen — surfacing anomalies and threats across the blockchain in real time.

- 🧠 **ShadowTrack** — Detection of irregular transaction patterns  
- 📈 **RiskPredict** — Pattern-based risk forecasting  
- 🕳️ **AnomalyScope** — Scans for behavioral and liquidity outliers  
- 🔔 **InsightGuard** — Alerts on suspicious transaction movement  
- 🛠️ Immersive Chrome Extension with live scanning  
- 🔗 Discord-based Access Sigil system deployed  
- 💠 $NOIRA token integrated for feature and role unlocking  

### 🟣 Phase II — Reactive Awareness *(Active Development)*  
**Status:** In Progress — Q4 2025

Noira moves from detection to intelligent response — layering behavior, refining alerts, and introducing signature-level fraud analysis.

- 🔍 **DeepTrack** — Multi-layer detection for high-risk transaction behavior  
- 💡 **RiskPulse** — Live risk temperature tracking per token  
- 🧪 **CryptoDetect** — Fraud signature and scam flag analysis  
- 🛡️ **ShadowGuard** — Predictive protection against exploit patterns  
- 📡 Enhanced alert logic and AI anomaly tagging  
- 🧩 Refined Discord role tiers and access integration  

### 🔴 Phase III — Predictive Autonomy *(Planned)*  
**Status:** Planned — Q1 2026

Noira shifts from defense to foresight.  
AI becomes proactive — anticipating threats before they form.

- 🛰️ **Flashloan Radar** — Tripwires for liquidity-based exploits  
- 🧬 **Advanced Sybil Analysis** — Detection of sybil clusters and wallet networks  
- 🧠 **AI Risk Engine** — Predictive scoring of actor behavior and token movement  
- 🗣️ **Sentiment Sync** — AI blending of social signals with on-chain data  
- 🌐 **Cross-Chain Watchtower** — Unified monitoring across multiple blockchains

## 🧠 AI Functionality

Noira Research is powered by a suite of anomaly-focused AI modules — each designed to detect abnormal behavior, assess market risk, and adapt to blockchain chaos in real time.

### 1. 🔎 ShadowTrack — Transaction Anomaly Detection

```python
def shadow_track(current_pattern, expected_pattern, threshold=0.5):
    pattern_deviation = abs(current_pattern - expected_pattern)

    if pattern_deviation > threshold:
        return '🔴 Alert: Anomalous Transaction Detected'
    else:
        return '✅ Transaction Normal'
```
#### What it does:
Compares observed transaction behavior to predicted baselines.
Used in clustering patterns for anomaly learning — helps define what “normal” looks like in volatile blockchain conditions.

### 2. ⚠️ RiskPredict — Market Risk Forecasting

```python
def risk_predict(price_change, previous_price, volume_change, previous_volume):
    price_volatility = abs(price_change / previous_price)
    market_momentum = volume_change / previous_volume

    risk_score = price_volatility * market_momentum

    if risk_score > 0.7:
        return '⚠️ Alert: High Market Risk Predicted'
    else:
        return '✅ Market Risk Low'
```
#### What it does:
Generates a dynamic risk score from volatility and momentum signals.
Forms the foundation of Noira’s real-time alert logic, adapting based on feedback loops and AI calibration.

### 3. 🕳️ AnomalyScope — Blockchain Anomaly Scanning

```js
function anomalyScope(transactionData) {
  const deviationFactor = Math.abs(transactionData.transactionValue / transactionData.marketLiquidity);
  const anomalyThreshold = 1.5;

  if (deviationFactor > anomalyThreshold) {
    return '🔍 Alert: Blockchain Anomaly Detected';
  } else {
    return '✅ Transaction Normal';
  }
}
```
#### What it does:
Flags value-based outliers — particularly risky in low-liquidity zones.
Helps detect early stages of rug pulls, pump setups, or stealth exploits.

### 4. 🚨 InsightGuard — Real-Time Alerts

```js
function insightGuard(transactionData) {
  const riskLevel = transactionData.amount / transactionData.totalTransactions;

  if (riskLevel > 0.2) {
    return '🚨 Alert: High-Risk Transaction Detected';
  } else {
    return '✅ Transaction Safe';
  }
}
```
#### What it does:
Detects abnormal spikes in transaction concentration.
Flags large transfers that dominate recent activity — a red flag for coordinated moves or hidden whale actions.

### 5. 🧨 ShadowGuard — Deep Risk Analysis

```python
def shadow_guard(current_price, previous_price, transaction_volume):
    price_deviation = abs(current_price - previous_price)
    risk_factor = (price_deviation / previous_price) * transaction_volume

    if risk_factor > 1000:
        return '🧨 Alert: Deep Risk Detected'
    else:
        return '✅ Transaction Risk Low'
```
#### What it does:
Combines price volatility and transaction volume to detect flash dumps, exploit activity, or rapid whale shifts.
Feeds into Noira’s predictive stack and upcoming Flashloan Radar module.

### 📡 AI Connection
Each of these functions acts as a node in Noira’s neural intelligence.
Together, they form an evolving detection mesh:
- 🔁 Data is fed into an adaptive pipeline: Raw → Risk → Pattern → Alert
- 🧠 Thresholds adjust over time based on live blockchain data and real exploit outcomes
- 🧬 AI evolves not just on logic — but on real market failures, frauds, and anomalies

> Noira doesn’t just detect outliers.
> It listens to what the chain is trying to say — and learns how to speak back.

## 🧾 Final Note

Noira was built for shadows — to trace what hides beneath the surface.  
It doesn’t chase hype. It listens for anomalies, detects intent, and learns from disruption.

> In a world of noise, Noira finds the signal.
